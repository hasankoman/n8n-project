# Merhaba Dünya Project

This project serves as a simple starting point, currently displaying the phrase "Merhaba Dünya" (Hello World in Turkish). It's designed to be easily expanded upon to demonstrate more complex concepts and functionality.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is currently very straightforward:

* `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

Currently, no external dependencies are required. The project only needs a text editor capable of handling Markdown files.

## Installation & Setup

No installation is needed. The project consists of a single `README.md` file. To view the project, simply open this file in a text editor or Markdown viewer.

## Usage Guide

At present, the project's functionality is limited to displaying the phrase "Merhaba Dünya". Further functionality will be added in future iterations.

## Future Development

Future plans include:

* Expanding the project to demonstrate more advanced programming concepts.
* Implementing new features and functionalities.
* Adding more comprehensive documentation and examples.
* Potentially incorporating a programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and demonstrating basic program execution.
