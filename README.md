It allows users to browse and search for brand colors, select colors to create a custom palette, and download the palette in CSS, SCSS, or LESS format. This clone provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and managing brand color information.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, React Modal, React Clipboard.js, React Content Loader, React LazyLoad, Sass, Font Awesome
* **Styling:** SCSS
* **Others:** JSON (for brand data), GitHub Pages (for deployment)

* **`src/`:** Contains the source code of the application.

    * **`src/App.js`:** The main application component. This is the root component and handles routing.
    * **`src/MainContext.js`:** Provides a context API for sharing state across components.
    * **`src/brands.json`:** A large JSON file containing data for different brands and their colors.

        * `Brand.js`: Displays a single brand with its colors.
        * `Collection.js`: Displays a collection of selected brands.
        * `CollectionBar.js`: The top bar in the collection view, allowing downloads and navigation.
        * `Content.js`: The main content area, displaying brands based on search or all brands.
        * `Copied.js`: A message indicating the copied color.
        * `Download.js`: Handles the download functionality for selected brands (CSS, SCSS, LESS).
        * `Loader.js`: A loading component for lazy-loading.
        * `Piece.js`: Displays individual brand details.
        * `PieceBrandBar.js`: Navigation bar for individual brand pages.
        * `SearchBar.js`: The search bar for filtering brands.
        * `Sidebar.js`: The sidebar with the logo, description, and "About" link.
    * **`src/helpers.js`:** Contains utility functions such as `getContrastYIQ`.
    * **`src/index.js`:** The entry point for the React application.
    * **`src/index.scss`:** Contains the global styling for the application.


## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a development server and runs the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

2. **Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the application for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` folder. The `homepage` field in `package.json` should be configured correctly for GitHub Pages deployment.
