* **`src/`:** Contains the source code of the application.

    * **`src/App.js`:** The main application component. This is the root component and handles routing.
    * **`src/MainContext.js`:** Provides a context API for sharing state across components.
    * **`src/brands.json`:** A large JSON file containing data for different brands and their colors.
    * **`src/components/`:** Contains various UI components:
        * `Brand.js`
        * `Collection.js`
        * `CollectionBar.js`
        * `Content.js`
        * `Copied.js`
        * `Download.js`
        * `Loader.js`
        * `Piece.js`
        * `PieceBrandBar.js`
        * `SearchBar.js`
        * `Sidebar.js`
    * **`src/helpers.js`:** Contains utility functions such as `getContrastYIQ`.
    * **`src/index.js`:** The entry point for the React application.
    * **`src/index.scss`:** Contains the global styling for the application.


## Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a development server and runs the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

2. **Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the application for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build` folder. The `homepage` field in `package.json` should be configured correctly for GitHub Pages deployment.
